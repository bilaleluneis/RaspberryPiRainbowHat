Description: 
        
        =======
        
        The pysmbus package is a pure Python reimplentation of the
        [python-smbus](http://www.lm-sensors.org/browser/i2c-tools/trunk/py-smbus/)
        package. This allows using the I2C SMBus protocol without having to compile C.
        
        It has the same module name, `smbus`, as `python-smbus`, so that it can
        be used as a direct replacement in projects that normally depend on
        `python-smbus`.
        
        Currently it's incomplete. The following methods are implemented:
        
            * write_byte_data
            * read_byte_data
        
        Other methods haven't been implemented yet, since I don't have any hardware
        needing those methods. Patches or requests for other methods are welcome.
        
        This package has been comfirmed working with Python 2.7 and 3.4.
        
        
        Example
        -------
        
            from smbus import SMBus
        
            bus = SMBus(1)  # Opens /dev/i2c-1
            bus.write_byte_data(0x54, 0x13, 0xff)
